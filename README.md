## Clustering Algorithms

Clustering algorithms are techniques used in data analysis to group a set of elements such that elements in each group (or cluster) are more similar to each other than to elements in other groups. Clustering is used in many fields such as machine learning, data analysis, and image classification.

### k-means Clustering

k-means is a popular clustering algorithm that partitions the data into \( k \) groups, where the variance within each group is minimized. The algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Initialization:** Choose \( k \) initial cluster centroids randomly.
2. **Assignment:** Assign each data point to the nearest cluster centroid.
3. **Update:** Calculate the new centroids by taking the mean of all data points assigned to each cluster.
4. **Repeat:** Repeat the assignment and update steps until the centroids do not change significantly.

### Hierarchical Clustering

Hierarchical clustering divides the data into groups based on a hierarchy, which can be either:

- **Agglomerative (bottom-up):** Start with each data point as its own cluster and iteratively merge the closest clusters until all points are merged into a single cluster or a desired number of clusters is reached.
- **Divisive (top-down):** Start with all data points in one cluster and iteratively split the clusters until each point is in its own cluster or a desired number of clusters is reached.

### DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that identifies clusters based on the density of data points. It is useful for discovering clusters of arbitrary shape and identifying noise (points that do not belong to any cluster). The algorithm works as follows:

1. **Core Points:** Identify points that have a sufficient number of neighboring points within a specified radius (Îµ).
2. **Cluster Formation:** Form clusters from core points and their neighbors.
3. **Noise Identification:** Mark points that are not core points and do not have enough neighbors as noise.

### Applications

These clustering algorithms are widely used in real-world applications such as:

- **Market Analysis:** Segmenting customers based on purchasing behavior.
- **Text Classification:** Grouping documents based on content.
- **Image Segmentation:** Dividing images into homogeneous regions.
